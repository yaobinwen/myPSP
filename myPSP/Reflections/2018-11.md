I need to figure out a way to manage the accumulated knowledge while I'm working on a task. At the beginning, I used my private work git repository; later I switched to use `YouTrack`.

The way you "manage the knowledge" on `YouTrack` is to keep appending comments to the task thread. As a result, the knowledge is spreaded into many comments and hard to be referred to or reorganized. The number of comments may quickly go up if you just want to write down a one-liner thought and come back to organize them later. But `YouTrack` provides you the built-in functions to track the status and consumed time, which is a really good feature.

Instead, if you use a private work git repository and a simple markdown document, you can easily put down the random thoughts and reorganize them later. But then you won't get benefit from the work tracking feature and have to calculate that manually.
